## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite applications are instagram, gmail, and messages. On instagram, I like how it is easy to navigate and the way that they color things(rings around stories) to grab your attention. Another feature I like is how you are used to the different gestures, ie. pulling down to refresh. On gmail, it is straightforward, the notification symbols are simple yet effective, the bolded highlights for unread emails, etc. On imessage, I like how you can set favorites, swipe to delete, and how sending certain messages can invoke different animations.  

In terms of app brainstorming, I think it would be cool to recreate the notes app in a way that feels more journal-like. You can write notes, add stickers, take pictures, and decorate however you like. Some features might involve having folders for different months, and different preset themes to use. 

## Notes

Challenges when making this app mainly involved getting used to Xcode, navigating and getting more familiar with the different functions. I am surprised by the presence of "drag and drop" and find it pretty interesting.
